Based on the conducted research, the best material for constructing a magnetic sensor is Ferrous metal or steel (fe360), so the parts are considered to be made of steel, and their permeability coefficients are determined as follows:

The physics of the magnetic field is added, and a coil with 1000 turns is placed on the first section, which is stimulated with a voltage of 220 volts. Force calculation is also added to calculate the force.

Then, meshing is performed, and a study is conducted. Parametric sweep is added, and distance is swept over the following range:

This result corresponds to the relationship between distance and magnetic force, which is F‚àù1/d.
